Hi, I am Watsh Rajneesh. Thank you for visiting my website. Here is a little bit about me:
- Software Engineer 
- Machine Learning Enthusiast
- Runner

I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics & Communications Science from [Shivaji University, Kolhapur, India](https://www.unishivaji.ac.in/). I have done my masters in Software Engineering from [San Jose State University, California](https://www.sjsu.edu/).  

I am a machine learning enthusiast, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow in this field. I am also a runner and I love to run marathons. I have completed several half-marathons and training for a full marathon in 2025.
