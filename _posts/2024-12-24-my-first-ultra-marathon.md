I ran my first ultra marathon in [Austin Rattler](https://www.austinrattler.com/run/) on Nov 2nd 2024 at Burnet, TX. I had trained for it for couple months especially the months of September and October. The venue was [Reveille Peak Ranch](https://www.rprtexas.com/). The course is somewhat technical and hilly. I could complete it in 8:13 hrs a distance of 31 miles approx or 50 Kms. It rained that day but the weather overall was very congenial and not too hot which helped in keeping us cool. The race started at 7am CST and the completion time was 3:30pm (max 8:30 hours). Prior to doing this race i had done 2 half-marathons earlier in this year - 3M half in January and Austin half in February. Other than those 2 races i had done Cap10K in April. 

Following is the running gear i used:
1. [Salomon ADV SKIN 12](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/adv-skin-12-lc11657.html)
2. [Salomon Trail Gaiter High](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/trail-gaiters-high.html)
3. [Salomon High Pulse Belt](https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/high-pulse-lc12900.html)
4. [Hoka Speedgoat 5 GTX](https://www.hoka.com/en/us/sale/speedgoat-5-gtx/1127912.html)
5. [Outdoor Research Cap](https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Research-Sun-Runner-White/dp/B0BRKN8BKF)

A good shoe is required. Also need to manage our nutrition during the run. I had 200 kcal per hour approx. Had used some peanut butter cookies, fig bars and whatever was available at the aid stations. 
For this race, the aid stations were 10 miles apart so we needed to carry enough supplies for water and nutrition on us during the run. I was prepared for that so it all worked out well. 

Post the run my right leg muscle was sore for almost 2-3 weeks. Surprisingly my left leg was perfectly fine and injury free. I could only manage to do some slow runs in 2nd and 3rd week after the event. For the future i have procured a massage chair and hopefully that will help in recovery.

Next i have signed up for 50 mile race at [Brazos Bend](https://www.trailracingovertexas.com/brazos-50) on April 5th, 2025.
